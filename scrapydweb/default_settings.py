############################## ScrapydWeb #####################################
# Setting SCRAPYDWEB_BIND to '0.0.0.0' or IP-OF-THE-CURRENT-HOST would make
# ScrapydWeb server visible externally; Otherwise, set it to '127.0.0.1'.
# The default is '0.0.0.0'.
SCRAPYDWEB_BIND = '0.0.0.0'
# Accept connections on the specified port, the default is 5000.
SCRAPYDWEB_PORT = 5000

# The default is False, set it to True to enable basic auth for web UI.
ENABLE_AUTH = False
# In order to enable basic auth, both USERNAME and PASSWORD should be non-empty strings.
USERNAME = ''
PASSWORD = ''

# The default is False, set it to True and add both CERTIFICATE_FILEPATH and PRIVATEKEY_FILEPATH
# to run ScrapydWeb in HTTPS mode.
# Note that this feature is not fully tested, please leave your comment here if ScrapydWeb
# raises any excepion at startup: https://github.com/my8100/scrapydweb/issues/18
ENABLE_HTTPS = False
# e.g. '/home/username/cert.pem'
CERTIFICATE_FILEPATH = ''
# e.g. '/home/username/cert.key'
PRIVATEKEY_FILEPATH = ''


############################## Scrapy #########################################
# ScrapydWeb is able to locate projects in the SCRAPY_PROJECTS_DIR,
# so that you can simply select a project to deploy, instead of packaging it in advance.
# e.g. 'C:/Users/username/myprojects/' or '/home/username/myprojects/'
SCRAPY_PROJECTS_DIR = ''


############################## Scrapyd ########################################
# Make sure that [Scrapyd](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapyd) has been installed
# and started on all of your hosts.
# Note that for remote access, you have to manually set 'bind_address = 0.0.0.0'
# in the configuration file of Scrapyd and restart Scrapyd to make it visible externally.
# Check out 'https://scrapyd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#example-configuration-file' for more info.
# ------------------------------ Chinese --------------------------------------
# 请先确保所有主机都已经安装和启动 [Scrapyd](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapyd)。
# 如需远程访问 Scrapyd，则需在 Scrapyd 配置文件中设置 'bind_address = 0.0.0.0'，然后重启 Scrapyd。
# 详见 https://scrapyd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#example-configuration-file

# - the string format: username:password@ip:port#group
#   - The default port would be 6800 if not provided,
#   - Both basic auth and group are optional.
#   - e.g. '127.0.0.1:6800' or 'username:password@localhost:6801#group'
# - the tuple format: (username, password, ip, port, group)
#   - When the username, password, or group is too complicated (e.g. contains ':@#'),
#   - or if ScrapydWeb fails to parse the string format passed in,
#   - it's recommended to pass in a tuple of 5 elements.
#   - e.g. ('', '', '127.0.0.1', '6800', '') or ('username', 'password', 'localhost', '6801', 'group')
SCRAPYD_SERVERS = [

]

# If both ScrapydWeb and one of your Scrapyd servers run on the same machine,
# ScrapydWeb would try to directly read Scrapy logfiles from disk, instead of making a request
# to the Scrapyd server.
# e.g. '127.0.0.1:6800' or 'localhost:6801', do not forget the port number.

# Note that you can run the LogParser service separately via command 'logparser' as you like.

############################## Timer Tasks ####################################
# Run ScrapydWeb with argument '-sw' or '--switch_scheduler_state', or click the ENABLED|DISABLED button
# on the Timer Tasks page to turn on/off the scheduler for the timer tasks and the snapshot mechanism below.

# The default is 300, which means ScrapydWeb would automatically create a snapshot of the Jobs page
# and save the jobs info in the database in the background every 300 seconds.
# Note that this behaviour would be paused if the scheduler for timer tasks is disabled.
# Set it to 0 to disable this behaviour.

############################## Email Notice ###################################
# In order to be notified (and stop or forcestop a job when triggered) in time,
# you can reduce the value of POLL_ROUND_INTERVAL and POLL_REQUEST_INTERVAL,
# at the cost of burdening both CPU and bandwidth of your servers.

# Tip: set SCRAPYDWEB_BIND to the actual IP of your host, then you can visit ScrapydWeb
# via the links attached in the email. (check out the "ScrapydWeb" section above)

#   - In order to avoid an UNCLEAN shutdown, the 'STOP' action would be executed one time at most
#   - if none of the 'FORCESTOP' triggers is enabled, no matter how many 'STOP' triggers are enabled.
# - LOG_XXX_TRIGGER_FORCESTOP (optional):

#   - The 'FORCESTOP' action would be executed if both of the 'STOP' and 'FORCESTOP' triggers are enabled.

# is NOT within the EMAIL_WORKING_DAYS and the EMAIL_WORKING_HOURS, though NO email would be sent.
